        <p>
            I'm a Computer Science student at the University of South Florida with a passion for building technology that makes a difference.
            <br><br>
            Throughout my academic journey, I’ve developed strong skills in programming, web development, and software engineering principles. I enjoy turning complex problems into simple, beautiful solutions — whether it's through developing applications, designing websites, or diving into data structures and algorithms.
            <br><br>
            Outside of academics, I'm constantly exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and staying curious about the future of tech. I'm excited to continue growing as a developer and contribute meaningfully to innovative projects.
